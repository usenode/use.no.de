<h1>Proton</h1>

<p>
    Proton is a tool for developing and running web applications for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. However, rather than being a web framework in itself, it just provides the mechanism for running a web application built on a compatible framework (e.g. <a href="/micro">micro</a>). Proton is designed to be a thin layer that does not mandate any particular framework.
